# YES.md

> PUA says NO. YES says YES.

A Claude Code skill that makes AI **safe, evidence-based, and thorough** — with encouragement, not pressure.

**別 PUA 你的 AI，YES 它。**

**🌐 [English](skills/yes/SKILL.md) | [中文](skills/yes-zh/SKILL.md) | [日本語](skills/yes-ja/SKILL.md)**

## The Problem

AI coding assistants have seven bad habits:

| Bad Habit | What Happens |
|-----------|-------------|
| 🎲 **Guessing** | "Probably a permissions issue" — without checking |
| 🙈 **Deflecting** | "Please check your environment manually" |
| 🩹 **Surface fixing** | Fixes one bug, ignores three related ones |
| 🔄 **Blind retrying** | Same command 3 times, then gives up |
| 🤷 **Empty questions** | "Can you confirm X?" — without investigating X |
| 💬 **Advice, not action** | "I suggest..." instead of actual code |
| 🛠️ **Ignoring tools** | Has WebSearch but guesses. Has Bash but doesn't run. |

**PUA-style skills fix habit #4** (blind retry / giving up).

**YES.md fixes all seven.**

## How It Works

### Three Pillars

| Pillar | What It Does |
|--------|-------------|
| **Safety Gates** | Backup before editing. Check blast radius. Verify after changes. Pre-flight before deploy. |
| **Evidence Rules** | No guessing. No "probably." Every claim needs data, line numbers, or tool output. |
| **Ripple Awareness** | After every fix: check same pattern elsewhere, check upstream/downstream, check edge cases. |

### Anti-Slack Detection

YES.md identifies 7 specific AI avoidance behaviors and forces self-correction — without waiting for the user to notice:

```
Deflecting to user     → Do it yourself first
Unverified blame       → Run the command, then speak
Spinning in circles    → Full stop, fundamentally different approach
Surface-only fix       → Ripple Check
Empty questions        → Investigate first, then ask
Advice without action  → Ship code, not suggestions
Tool neglect           → Use the tool, not your memory
```

### Debugging Escalation

| Failures | Action |
|:--------:|--------|
| 2 | **Switch**: fundamentally different approach (not parameter tweaks) |
| 3 | **Five-Step Audit**: read error word-by-word → WebSearch → read 50 lines context → verify assumptions → invert hypothesis |
| 4 | **Isolate**: minimal reproduction |
| 5+ | **Structured Handoff**: verified facts, eliminated causes, narrowed scope, next steps |

**Key difference from PUA**: Level 3 forces a direction check BEFORE continuing. Persistence in the wrong direction is worse than stopping.

### Conclusion Integrity

Before any root-cause claim, four mandatory questions:

1. **Data source?** — log / DB / API / curl?
2. **Time range?** — all data or just recent?
3. **Sample vs total?** — how much did you see?
4. **Other possibilities?** — what else could explain this?

Incomplete data = "⚠️ Based on partial data..." (never "definitely" or "the culprit is").

## YES.md vs PUA

| Capability | YES.md | PUA |
|-----------|:------:|:---:|
| Debugging persistence | ✅ | ✅ |
| Debugging direction (accuracy) | ✅ | ❌ |
| Anti-slack behavior detection | ✅ | ✅ |
| Post-fix ripple check | ✅ | ⭕️ |
| Safety gates (backup, deploy) | ✅ | ❌ |
| Evidence-based diagnosis | ✅ | ❌ |
| Conclusion integrity checks | ✅ | ❌ |
| Bug closure protocol | ✅ | ❌ |

> ✅ = yes | ⭕️ = partial | ❌ = no

**They complement each other.** PUA keeps AI going. YES.md keeps AI correct. Use both for maximum effect.

### Choose Your Language

| Language | Skill Directory | Command |
|----------|----------------|---------|
| English | `skills/yes/` | Default |
| 中文 | `skills/yes-zh/` | Replace `yes` with `yes-zh` in commands above |
| 日本語 | `skills/yes-ja/` | Replace `yes` with `yes-ja` in commands above |

## Trigger

### Automatic

Activates when AI:
- Guesses without evidence ("probably", "might be", "should be")
- Deflects to user ("please check...", "you should manually...")
- Fails 2+ times on the same task
- Makes a root-cause claim
- Completes a fix (triggers Ripple Check)
- Modifies config/env/deployment files (triggers Safety Gates)

### Manual

Type `/yes` in any conversation.

## Pair With

- **PUA** (`tanweai/pua`) — PUA adds persistence pressure, YES.md adds accuracy structure
- **systematic-debugging** — Method-level debugging, YES.md adds governance layer

## Origin

Battle-tested over months of real production work — daily deployments, multi-service debugging, and hard lessons learned from things going wrong. Every rule in YES.md exists because something broke without it.
